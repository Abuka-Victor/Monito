## Description
Monito is an app mainly for students who want to declutter their lives. It stems from a problem observed in Nigerian tertiary institutions where students find it difficult to find important information on class group chats due to the amount of not so relevant conversations happening on said group chats. It is intended as a virtual notice board of some sort to get students up to speed on the latest info at every point in time. The duty to post such information falls on the class representatives who will invite class members to notice boards.
